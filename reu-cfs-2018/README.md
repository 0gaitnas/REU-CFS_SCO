# Computing For Structure:
_A reserach experience for undergraduate at the university of miami_

The bootcamp ran from Monday 21 May 2018 through the Wednesday 30 May, 
with Monday the 28th off for Memorial Day. 

The bootcamp had two sections. 

The first section until Thursday focused on Unix skills,
the Python language, and data analysis. The presenters for this 
section were 
* Athena Hadjixenofontos, CCS researcher. data analysis
* Kalan Dawson, CCS researcher. Unix competence.
* Burton Rosenberg: CSC professor. python

The second section was about the high performance computing approaches of grid, 
neural nets, and CUDA. The presenters were:
* Kalan Dawson and Pedro Davila CCS researchers, grid (Pegasus)
* Luis Gonzalo Sanchez CSC researcher, neural nets
* Burton Rosenberg CSC professor, CUDA.

This archives the materials used by Burt in the bootcamp (hey! it's my git!)
* _python-the-language_, introduction to the python language and Jupyter by Burt Rosenberg. 
This was used sporadically, as we focused more on Makefile, subversion, and command line python.
* _samples_, a series of challenge python programs. theses were pulled from a subversion
repository, and the student responded by completing them in a parallel folder.
* _examples_, examples used in the Numby presentation to explore the underlying C language arrays
* _cuda_, a series of cuda programs for the cuda presentation. The last program was
a challenge problem for the student to complete.
