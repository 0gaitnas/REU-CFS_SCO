# Computing For Structure:
_A reserach experience for undergraduate at the university of miami_

The bootcamp was extended to 7 days: Monday 21 May 2018 through the Wednesday 30 May, 
with Monday the 28th off for Memorial Day. 

The bootcamp had two sections. The first section until Thursday focused on Unix skills,
the Python language, and data analysis. The second section was about the high performance 
computing approaches of grid, neural nets, and CUDA. The bootcamp concluded with a quasi-social
with the mentors, to have overall introductions, and for the mentors to have specific
discussions with their mentees.

The first week bootcamp data is archived in:
* _python-the-language_, introduction to the python language and Jupyter by Burt Rosenberg
* _python-for-data-analysis_, introduction to exploratory data analysis in scipy, by Athina Hadjixenofontos
* _matlab-tutorial_, an introduction to matlab, and an experiment in PCA, by Odelia Schwartz
