the kernel is compiled on the host and downloaded to the gpu.

host copies data from host memory to the gpu global memory

host launches threads, which are arranged in blocks

threads are inside a block. 

all threads can access a common global memory

threads in a block access a per block shared memory

shared memory is faster; and can be very fast if accessed correctly

threads can synchronize in a block.

blocks must be synchronized by the host, using streams

data copies host to/from gpu synchronize the stream

threads and blocks can be indexed in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.

multidimensional indices are simply a programming convenience.

the __global__ attribute identifies gpu code accessible by the host

the __device__ attribute identifies code accessbible within the gpu
