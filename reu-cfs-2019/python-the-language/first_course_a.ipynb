    "The Python programming language began around 1990, designed by Guido van Rossum. It is a modern interpreted language supporting a high level of convenience and data abstraction. It competes with Ruby and somewhat with PERL for a universal next-generation language. In the desire to apply Python to scientific problems, the SciPy project provides libraries for highly efficient scientific computation. SciPy is packaged so that it can be installed easily. As a final layer, Jupyter provides a sort of integrated environment of documentation, editing and running Python programs in frameworks called Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation on python is available at https://docs.python.org/3/. There are two versions of Python and they are incompatible. The 2.7 is the final version 2. We will use version 3.\n",

    "### Def's, if-else, scopes and namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "There are about four different types of code flow in a program: \n",
    "* the normal top to bottom statement by statement; \n",
    "* the function call and return; \n",
    "* the if-else; \n",
    "* the loop; \n",
    "* and the exception or catch-throw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define functions with the keyword \"def\" followed by the function name and parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the function is one line, follow this by the : and that one line. Else follow this by the : \n",
    "and a sequence of lines, all exactly indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language has this weirdness that indentation must be respected. And it can be annoying, as differences between spaces and tabs will cause errors. I find it best to work with an programmer's editor that has a \"Show Invisibles\" option. Under this option, the invisible characters, including space, tab and return, show as a special glyph, so you can see exactly the nature of your white space.\n"

    "The variety of computer languages hides the fact that in essence all programming languages are equally powerful. What can be done in one, can be done in another. As an example, while a looping construct is present in all computing languages, and seemingly essential, looping can be created from if-else and function calls. Rather than returning up on the code flow, the function calls another invocation of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A demonstration of this help clarify that the value of next-generation programming languages is not in absolute expresssiveness (which means &mdash; what can or can not be done in the language) but in convenience and in intuitive mnemonics for structuring one's thoughts about computer programs.\n",

    "The data environment in which runs your Python script as a nesting of *namespaces*. A namespace is a collection of name-object pairs. (For now, object means value. Everything in Python is an object.) When a name is encountered, containing namespaces are search for a match, in order of the nesting of namespaces. The first match in the nesting is taken, and the pair is either accessed for the object value from the pair or updated with a new object value set to the pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *scope* of a variable is more or less which namespace it is in, however it refers more to which lines of code in which the namespace is effective. Each function is a scope and creates its own namespace. In a departure from a lexical view to a semantic of dynamic view, when a function calls itself, a new namespace is created for each call. The nesting of namespaces make for a stacking of variables and appropriate hiding and later recovery of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example following, the scope of x is the entire boom function. On each call, a new namespace containing the pair x and a value (actually a number object). I provide both boom and boom_alt, which shows the discarding of covering namespaces as the function returns.\n"

An assignment statement at file level will also create a name-value pair in this namespace.\n",
