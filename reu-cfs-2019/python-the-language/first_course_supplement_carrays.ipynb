    "#### Numpy,  strides, shapes and views\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>ndarray</code> type provided by the NumPy library is an efficient and flexible array for scientific computing. It is a Python object that represents simply shaped arrays of a homogeneous, arithmetic type. Internally, there is a C-array, and the ultimate computation will be done with processor-native addressing as in C. The representation of the array is provided to Python through the object's _shape_ and _stride_ properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _stride_ of an k-dimensional array is a k-tuple, where each dimension gives the number of bytes to skip to access consecutive elements along that dimension. The _shape_ of a k-dimensional array is a k-tuple giving the number of elements in that that dimension.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "C fixes the stride at compile time, and no introspective access to that stride, or way to change it. Python can introspect and reassign the stride when creating alternative _views_ of the same ndarray.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "C is also unconcerned about the shape of an array. You can put arbitrary numbers into the indices and something will happen, although not always what you want to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "A _view_ is an alternative indexing into an array. It might or might no be a copy, depending on whether the view is possible by manipulating strides alone, or applying transpose maps to the indices. For instance, the view generated by taking every other element in the array, given by the slice notation <code>[::2]</code>, does not require a copy of the array, but simply doubles the stride in the particular dimension. The transpose operator exchanges the stride and shape values, creating a new view of the array without rewriting memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The strides for an ndarray can be retrived as the strides property of the ndarray object, and is a k-tuple of integers for a k-dimensional ndarray. The shape of an ndarray is in effect the collection of strides. A simple exercise is to call <code>reshape(-1)</code>, which will flatten the ndarray shape into a one dimensional sequence of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arrays in C\n",
    "\n",
    "The technology behind the ndarray is to wrap native arrays, as represented in C language, inside a Python object. To better understand ndarrays, we discuss how C handles arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer memory is a sequence of bytes. Each byte has an address, and given an address a, the following bytes in memory are at numerically ascending addresses &mdash; a+1, a+2, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "C data types are either primitive to the language, or user defined, and each requires one or multiple bytes in consecutive locations in memory for the storage of values of the type. The C keyword *sizeof* returns the number of bytes required for the type. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primitive types in C reflect the available hardware circuitry. The ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) contains circuitry that perfors operations of representations of signed or unsigned integers; the FPU (Floating Point Unit) contains circuitry that performs operations on floating point representations of real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a primitive is stored in multiple bytes, those bytes are stored in consecutive locations in memory, begining at an address that is divisible by the data item's size. For example, a 64-bit integer is stored in 8 bytes, beginning at an address divisible by 8. This is called _data alignment_ and it could be said that this data is \"long integer aligned\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "In C, an array of type T is a sequence of elements of type T arranged sequentially in memory. This allows that that i-th element of the sequece be located in memory according the the formula,\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "&amp;a[i] = a + i * sizeof(T).   \n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "For instance, if a[] is an array of int, and each int is 4 bytes, i.e. sizeof(int)==4, then the i-th element in the array is found at 4 * i bytes from the beginning of the array. C does not really know what it is accessing, but simply follows the above formula. This is compared to Python, where a data element is an object, and can be inspected. A  data element is just a sequence of bytes in memory. If i is incorrect, to large, or negative, C dutifuly goes to that location in memory and uses the next sizeof(T) bytes as a data item of type T, whether that makes sense or not.\n",
