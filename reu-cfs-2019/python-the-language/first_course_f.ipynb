    "Python is being used increasingly as a language for scientific computing because of its qualities as a programing language and because of community developed libraries extending the langauges abilities. One concern with using a powerful language like Python is that it loses the efficiency of languages which run \"closer to the metal\", although the analogy should be \"closer to the silicon\". For instance, programs written in C can be very efficient to run but they are not efficient to code. C codes slowly and requires extreme attention to detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SciPy initiative attempts to solve this efficiency gap, and present powerful, efficient libraries of Python code for scientific programing. Some of these libraries are written in C to truely extend the way the language represents and manipulates data. These abilities are brought into your programs using an _import_ statement, naming a package or module that contains definitions. These then become avaiable for use in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy includes NumPy for numeric arrays, MatPlotLib for making graphs, and Pandas for tabularizing and cleaning data. In this page we talk about NumPy. The entire scipy library is described at [scipy.org](https://www.scipy.org/docs.html). One might also look at the [scipy-lectures](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html) tutoral.\n",

Packages are collections of modules, represented as entire directory trees of modules. An import statement is of the form  import-as or from-import-as.\n",
    "\n",
    "Import statements must first find the module in the system enviornment, then make the contents available by populating the local namespace. A simple _import module_ command finds a file with the same name as the module name and populates a local namespace of the same name as the module name. If one wishes the local namespace name to be different, use _import module as name-. \n",
    "\n",
    "The from form of the import statement, _from module import name as name_, operates by first looking up the module, then introducing namespaces one by one, according to the trailing name-as clauses.\n",

An ndarray is represented in memory as a block of memory, an indexing function (the array's shape) and an base type (some sort of number). The indexing function gives the number of dimensions, the size along each dimension, and a _stride_ indicating offsets between successive elements in a dimension. \n",

    "The strides for an ndarray can be retrived as the strides property of the ndarray object, and is a k-tuple of integers for a k-dimensional ndarray.

For instance, the view generated by taking every other element in the array, given by the slice notation [::2], does not require a copy of the array, but simply doubles the stride in the particular dimension. The transpose operator exchanges the stride and shape values, creating a new view of the array without rewriting memory.\n"
